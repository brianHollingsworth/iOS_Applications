# iOS_Applications

These are some of my favorite iOS applications that I have made in my free time when I'm not doing homework.

1.) Marnanteli's Pizza: This is my in-progress attempt at creating an official app for a restaurant at which I am a manager. I have put ~20 hours into this app so far, and my Computer Science coursework at St. Cloud State has brought the app's progress to a standstill.

2.) Ultra 2016: A useful countdown utility that allows me to check how many days remain until I get to return to my favorite music festival, Ultra Music Festival in Miami. I made this app because it became rather tedious to Google "How many days until March 18th, 2016?" every time the thought of Ultra popped into my head. Now, I can simply raise my wrist and glance at my Apple Watch to see the countdown.
